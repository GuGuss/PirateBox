PirateBox 3.0
=============

Complete revamp of the Piratebox UI with additional features.

Warning: This is still in heavy development and has not yet been tested on an actual box !

###Features###

Here is an overview of the available features:
- Scalable artchitecture
The interface can be easily extended with extensions (chat, forum, map...).
- Responsive design
The layout is perfectly displayed on any screen size (mobile, desktop...).
- Admin UI
The admin user can log in and configure some basic stuff.
- Welcome popup
The first time the homepage loads, a popup window is displayed to explain to the user what is a Piratebox.
This could be handled as an extension.

The interface can be translated in different language and the user can choose is language.
The default language selected is the one of the user browser.
