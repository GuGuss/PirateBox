Hello, this is Nargren and I would like to first of all thank you for downloading my design for your PirateBox.

If you like my design, keep an eye on my blog at 
http://ubuntuhak.blogspot.com
where I am posting the updates and improvements I make.
 
Please also leave a feedback or any suggestions on my blog about my work/design. If you tell me what you are looking for, it is easier for me to try and design it.
Thank you.

###---How to install---###

1. Unpack the tar.gz file
2. Backup your current design and www folder
3. Copy over all the files to your piratebox/www folder by replacing any files using the same filename.

#CUSTOMIZER FOR YOUR NEEDS
4. Specially in my 2.0 design you can pretty much change any text in the html documents (even the image) as the layout is organized by the css file and it will not (should not) change. If you do not need for example the mobile tag, feel free to remove it or do any other laterations to your copy.
5. (OPTIONAL)If you already have your own forum, simply copy it over to your /piratebox/www folder and name it forum.html

By default the share folder is "/Share", if you have anything else than this please change index.html accordingly.

###---How to delete---###

Simply remove the files from your piratebox/www folder and copy over the new ones you are planning to use.
